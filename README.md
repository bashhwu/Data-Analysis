# Data-Analysis-Power-Bi

In this repo, the tool of Power Bi is used to analyze different types of datasets. The first report, namely Analysis of  Chicago Train Ridership Data using Power Bi tries to gain insights from the data. I am currently still working on it..

You can dowload the data by clicking the following link:

I have used three files for this repo. These are: Chicago_employment.csv, Entries.csv, Chicago_gas_prices.csv
